# Agent Contract: ShruggieTech

**Read this before writing any UI. It takes a minute and it is binding.**

You are working inside a brand with a fixed vocabulary. If you need a value
that is not in this document, **stop and ask**. Do not invent one, and do not
reach for a stock Tailwind palette class because it is faster.

## The stop condition

Inventing a colour, a spacing value, a radius, a font, or a component prop is
the failure this contract exists to prevent. When the vocabulary below does not
cover what you need, say so and wait.

## Colour: use the slot, never the value

Write `bg-primary`, `text-muted-foreground`, `border-border`. Never write a
hex, an `rgb()`, or `bg-slate-900`.

| Slot | Dark | Light |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `background` | `#000000` | `#F8F8F6` |
| `foreground` | `#FFFFFF` | `#0A0A0A` |
| `card` | `#0D0F12` | `#FFFFFF` |
| `primary` | `#2BCC73` | `#037B40` |
| `muted-foreground` | `#9A9A9A` | `#6B6B6B` |
| `destructive` | `#E9505F` | `#C0293A` |
| `border` / `input` | `#262626` | `#E5E5E5` |

### Three colour mistakes that get made constantly

1. **White text on the accent.** `#FFFFFF` on `#2BCC73` measures 2.1:1 and
   fails. The legal foreground is `#000000` at 9.99:1. Use
   `text-primary-foreground` and it is handled.
2. **The bright accent as text on a light surface.** `#2BCC73` measures 1.98:1
   on `#F8F8F6`. The light block already substitutes `#037B40`. Never override it.
3. **`#C24000` as text.** It measures 4.03:1 on the dark base. It is a fill.
   White on it measures 5.21:1.

## Spacing and radius

Spacing scale, in px: 4/8/12/16/24/32/48/64/96/120. Nothing between them.

Radii: `rounded-sm` 6 (chips), `rounded-md` 8 (buttons, inputs, popovers),
`rounded-xl` 12 (cards, dialogs), `rounded-2xl` 16, `rounded-full` (badges).
Never `rounded-none`, never an arbitrary `rounded-[...]`.

Layout: content 1200px, narrow 720px. Gutters 24px then 48px then 80px. Section rhythm 120px then 160px then 200px.

## Type

Space Grotesk for display at 500/700. Geist for body at 400/500. Geist Mono for labels,
code, and metadata.

**Geist has no 700 and Geist Mono has no bold.** Asking for a weight that does
not exist makes the renderer synthesise a faux bold, which prints badly and
forces outlined glyphs into PDFs. In mono, carry emphasis with colour.

## Density

Two settings ship, and both are correct in the right place. Default for
marketing and reading surfaces; compact for dense tabular data. Do not invent
a third.

## Icons

lucide, inline SVG, `currentColor`, 1.5 to 2px stroke on a 24 grid. Do not
install another icon library. If lucide lacks a domain symbol, it goes in
`icons/` drawn to the same spec.

## Accessibility, non-negotiable

- Visible 2px focus ring at 2px offset on every interactive element
- Status never carried by colour alone; pair it with a label or a shape
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`
- WCAG AA at rendered size

## Copy

Never build a sentence out of `X, not Y`, or `X over Y`, or
`rather than merely Z`. It is the clearest tell of machine-written copy.
Avoid em-dashes; use parentheses, commas, or hyphens. No testimonials, no
feature grids standing in for an explanation, no manufactured urgency.

## Before you call it done

```bash
npx eslint --config enforcement/eslint.brand.mjs .
npx stylelint --config enforcement/stylelint.config.json "**/*.css"
python3 build/verify.py
```

A build that fails any of these is not finished, whatever it looks like.

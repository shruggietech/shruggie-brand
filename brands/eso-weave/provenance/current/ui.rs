//! egui rendering for the main window.
//!
//! This layer reads the [`AppModel`] view and raises intents. It was long treated
//! as carrying no correctness-bearing logic and excluded from the tested surface,
//! validated only by a manual checklist. That was wrong, and it cost four releases:
//! the window-sizing defects of issues #4, #5, #8, #12, #13, and #14 all lived
//! here, in the glue between the pure helpers in [`crate::app`] and egui, while
//! every one of those helpers' own tests stayed green.
//!
//! The sizing behavior is therefore covered by `tests/app_ui_sizing.rs`, which
//! drives [`EsoWeaveApp::frame_ui`] through a headless egui harness and asserts
//! rendered geometry: the intrinsic content extent, the minimum pushed to the
//! viewport across a simulated resize gesture, the log pane's never-overlap
//! boundary under drag and resize, and the settings modal's rendered rectangle.
//! What remains manual is appearance rather than geometry (color, wording, hover
//! affordances) plus the real window-manager drag, which only a desk run exercises.
//!
//! Rendering uses a central panel (menu bar, status region, and skills), an
//! optional resizable bottom panel for the live log, and a settings modal, keeping
//! to a small, stable set of egui widgets plus a few brand presentation helpers.

## Notes

- Validation passed on the first review iteration.
- Issues #199 and #200 intentionally form one slice because they modify the same homepage portfolio component, styles, and browser-verification path.
- Security and tenancy applicability is explicit: this static public surface has no authentication, private data, tenant boundary, or user input; relevant interaction safety remains covered by destination and hidden-focus checks.
